# NeuralNet
An implementation of a simple neural network, with a training algorithm using stochastic gradient descent. The implementation is just a quick protoptype.

To run the example, you need the images and labels from the MNIST database of handwritten digits, which can be found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
